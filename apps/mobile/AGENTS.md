# Mobile App — AGENTS.md

> The mobile app is an Expo + React Native client that talks to the

## Quick reference

| Concern | Where |
|---------|-------|
| App entry | `app/_layout.tsx` (root Stack) |
| Screens | `app/*.tsx` (Expo Router, file-system routing) |
| Component tests | `__tests__/` mirroring the `app/` tree (Expo Router treats every file in `app/` as a route — see ADR 053) |
| E2E flows | `.maestro/flows/*.yaml` (one per user journey) |
| API mocks | `jest.spyOn(globalThis, 'fetch')` inline per test (see "API mocking" section). |
| Metro pnpm config | `metro.config.js` — **do not touch without reading ADR 053** (SDK 54 default-config, supersedes ADR 052 §3) |
| Test framework setup | `jest.config.js` + `jest.setup.ts` |
| App identifier | `app.json` → `expo.ios.bundleIdentifier` (`dev.matthewcarr.travelplanner`) |
| URL scheme | `app.json` → `expo.scheme` (`travelplanner://`) |

## Dev loop

From the repo root:

```bash
pnpm dev:mobile        # starts Expo Metro; prints QR code
pnpm test:mobile       # Jest unit + component tests (mobile only)
pnpm test:mobile:watch # Jest watch mode (TDD loop)
pnpm test:e2e:mobile   # Maestro E2E only (requires Maestro + iOS Simulator)
pnpm test:e2e          # umbrella — Playwright (web) + Maestro (mobile) together
pnpm type-check:mobile # tsc --noEmit on the mobile app only
pnpm lint              # repo-wide Biome — lints apps/mobile/app/** + apps/mobile/*.{ts,tsx,js,mjs} via biome.json includes
```

To run on the author's iPhone: scan the QR with the Expo Go app
(install from App Store). Expo Go runs the unsigned bundle
indefinitely — no Apple Developer Program required.

To run on the iOS Simulator: press `i` in the Metro CLI after
`pnpm dev:mobile`.

## Architecture

For slice 5 the app is a single screen. As slices 6+ add navigation,
state, and API calls, the conventions below come into force.

### File-system routing (Expo Router)

- `app/index.tsx` is the entry screen.
- `app/<name>.tsx` is a route at `/<name>`.
- `app/<name>/<sub>.tsx` is a nested route.
- `app/_layout.tsx` wraps a directory with a layout component.
- Modal/transparent presentations: see Expo Router docs.

### TestID convention (load-bearing for Maestro)

Every interactive element AND every screen-root view MUST carry a
stable `testID`. Naming pattern: `<screen>-<element>`.

Examples:

- Root `<View>` of `app/index.tsx` → `testID="hello-screen-root"`
- Login Google button → `testID="login-google-button"`
- Me screen sign-out → `testID="me-screen-sign-out"`

Maestro flows reference these rather than visible text. Text
changes are cheap; testID changes break flows.

### Component testing (Jest + RNTL)

Tests live under `apps/mobile/__tests__/` mirroring the `app/` tree.
**Never put test files inside `app/`** — Expo Router would treat
them as routes and bundle them into the iOS app, which then pulls
RNTL's Node-only `console` / `util` requires into the native bundle
and crashes the bundler (see ADR 053).

For `app/foo.tsx` the test lives at `__tests__/app/foo.test.tsx` and
imports the source as `from '../../app/foo'`. Use
`@testing-library/react-native` queries (`screen.getByTestId`,
`screen.getByText`, etc.). Extend-expect matchers (`toBeOnTheScreen`,
`toHaveTextContent`) are wired in `jest.setup.ts`.

```tsx
// __tests__/app/my-screen.test.tsx
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react-native';
import MyScreen from '../../app/my-screen';

describe('MyScreen', () => {
  it('renders the heading', () => {
    render(<MyScreen />);
    expect(screen.getByTestId('my-screen-heading')).toBeOnTheScreen();
  });
});
```

### API mocking (fetch spy)

Slice 6 introduced the first `/api/v1/*` calls. Network mocking
uses `jest.spyOn(globalThis, 'fetch')` directly per test —
Node 18+ provides a global `fetch`, jest can spy on it, and
canned `Response` objects cover the needed scenarios. See
`apps/mobile/src/api/client.ts` for the wrapper this fronts and
`apps/mobile/__tests__/api/client.test.ts` for the canonical
test shape.

```ts
const spy = jest.spyOn(globalThis, 'fetch');
spy.mockResolvedValueOnce(
  new Response(JSON.stringify({ message: 'pong' }), { status: 200 }),
);
const result = await apiPost('/api/v1/echo', {}, echoResponseSchema);
expect(result).toEqual({ ok: true, data: { message: 'pong' } });

afterEach(() => jest.restoreAllMocks());
```

**Why not msw?** Evaluated during SPEC-006 step 4 and deferred —
msw 2.x's transitive ESM dependency graph (`rettime`, `until-async`,
`outvariant`, `@bundled-es-modules/*`, ...) needs substantial
`transformIgnorePatterns` + `moduleNameMapper` expansion under
jest-expo 54 to load. The fetch-spy pattern has zero third-party
surface area, ships no new transform config, and covers slice 6's
test needs without ongoing maintenance. The `msw` dep is still in
`devDependencies` for a future spec to revisit if richer request
matching / response templating / multi-handler routing becomes a
real test need. To reactivate, see the SPEC-006 implementation
notes for the configuration sketch.

### Maestro flows (E2E)

One YAML per user journey under `.maestro/flows/`. Examples:

- `launch.yaml` — app boots and the Hello screen renders.
- `login.yaml` — slice 6's sign-in journey.
- `me-screen.yaml` — slice 7's milestone journey.

Use `id:` selectors over visible-text selectors where possible.

## Pnpm + Metro

The repo uses pnpm's isolated linker. As of Expo SDK 54+,
`expo/metro-config`'s `getDefaultConfig()` detects the pnpm workspace
and configures `watchFolders`, `resolver.nodeModulesPaths`, and
symlink resolution automatically — so `metro.config.js` is just the
minimal `getDefaultConfig(__dirname)` call. ADR 053 supersedes ADR 052
§3 here. **Do not re-add manual `watchFolders` / `nodeModulesPaths` /
`disableHierarchicalLookup` overrides** — they break transitive-dep
resolution under SDK 54 (the bug ADR 053 fixes). The hoisted-linker
escape hatch from ADR 052 §3 still stands if Metro regresses on pnpm
in a future SDK.

## Doc review — keeping mobile docs true

| You changed… | Check these docs |
|---|---|
| `app/` structure or routing | This file's "Architecture" section |
| Add a new screen / Maestro flow / testID convention | This file's "Quick reference" + an entry per convention |
| `metro.config.js` | ADR 052; smoke-test that `pnpm dev:mobile` still resolves all imports |
| Expo SDK version (`package.json`) | [ADR 053](../../docs/decisions/053-expo-sdk-54-temporary-downgrade.md) (current pin is SDK 54) and ADR 052 §1 (original SDK rationale); verify jest-expo + RNTL versions still match the new SDK's bundled-native-modules manifest |
| `app.json` (`bundleIdentifier`, `scheme`) | ADR 052; any active Maestro flows referencing the bundleIdentifier |
| CI workflow (mobile jobs in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) | This file's "Dev loop" section; ADR 052's CI table |

## Prerequisites for future slices

These are tracked here because they don't belong in the SPEC files
they depend on (the prerequisite is "future-you ran a test before
opening the next SPEC").

- [ ] **Partner-device Expo Go validation** — before slice 6 begins,
  the partner must successfully install Expo Go on her iPhone, scan
  the project URL, and see the Hello screen. If this fails, EPIC-001
  §9's partner-device kill criterion fires; slice 6 is re-planned
  (PWA pivot or fast-track EAS Build via funded Apple Developer
  Program). See SPEC-003 §6.
- [ ] **`mobile-e2e` CI job actually runs flows** — currently a
  placeholder per TD-002. Land the simulator-boot + dev-client build
  wiring before slice 6 introduces a `login.yaml` Maestro flow that
  also needs to run.
